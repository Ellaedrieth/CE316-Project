Hello everyone,

This project has been created by İzmir University of Economics students **Büşra Yılmaz**, **Sedat Nail Ersoy**, and **Ayça Dernek** for the course **CE 316**, Programming Paradigms. 

The project aims to create an **Integrated Assignment Environment (IAE) management system** using various technologies. The primary goal is to compile the students' code according to a new assignment created 
by the instructor, and then compare it with the output file prepared by the lecturer. 

In this way, the students' success rates for the assignment can be observed. Additionally, the instructor can add new programming languages that are not pre-configured in the program through the new configuration
option available in our program. Below, some screenshots and details taken during the program's operation are examined.

As seen on the screen, the comparison of the students' code outputs with the instructor's uploaded output files, based on the assignment selected from the open projects choice box menu, will be displayed on a table. 
-  New assignments can be added from the project menu, and the configuration menu, new configurations can be added in addition to the existing ones, or the existing configurations can be edited or deleted.
-   After adding a new assignment, pressing the refresh button is necessary for the project to appear in the open projects choice box.
-   Once the assignment is selected, pressing the run button will compile/interpret the results, and by clicking the show results button, the pass-fail ratios will be observed as true-false on the table view.

**2. New Project (Assignment) Screen:**

This screen is designed for the instructor to create a new assignment to test the students. 
- After entering the project's name, a configuration is selected either from the existing configurations (the language to be compiled/interpreted) or by pressing the create new button to add a new configuration if
  it does not already exist.
- After selecting the zip file containing the students' code and the output file (with .txt extension) containing the actual results, a new assignment is created by pressing the generate button.

**3. New Configuration Screen:**

The configuration the lecturer wants to add can be integrated into the program through this screen. After entering the required information into the respective text fields, a new configuration is added by clicking 
the generate button. 
- If the programming language being added does not have a compilation feature, "Null" should be entered in the relevant field.

**4. Open Configuration Screen:**

When an existing configuration needs to be edited in the program, the configuration name is entered, and upon clicking the open button, the details of the configuration appear in the respective text fields. All features except
for the configuration name can be updated.
- If an existing configuration needs to be deleted from the program, entering the configuration name and clicking the delete button will remove all details related to that configuration.

**5. Help Screen:**
